- In C#, the Singleton pattern will ensure that there is only one instance of a class is created in the CLR. 
- It is used to provide global point of access to the object. 
- In terms of practical use Singleton patterns are used in logging, caches, thread pools, configuration settings, device driver objects. 
- Design pattern is often used in conjunction with Factory design pattern. This pattern is also used in Service Locator
